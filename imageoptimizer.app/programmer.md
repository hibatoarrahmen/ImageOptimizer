Image Optimizer Application Documentation

## Overview

The Image Optimizer application is a Flask-based web application designed to optimize images by compressing them using OpenCV. The application allows users to upload images, specify the desired quality, and download the compressed image.

## Directory Structure

app: Contains the Flask application code, including routes, templates, and configuration files.
instance: Contains instance-specific configuration files.
templates: Contains HTML templates for the application.
uploads: Contains uploaded image files.

## Configuration

The application uses a configuration file config.py located in the instance directory. The configuration file contains the following settings:

SECRET_KEY: A secret key used for secure sessions.
UPLOAD_FOLDER: The directory where uploaded images are stored.

## Routes

The application has two routes:

/: The home page, which renders the base.html template.
/upload: Handles image uploads, compression, and download.

## Upload Route

The /upload route accepts POST requests with the following parameters:

image: The image file to be uploaded.
quality: The desired quality for image compression (optional, default is 90).

The route performs the following actions:

1. Validates the uploaded image file.
2. Compresses the image using OpenCV with the specified quality.
3. Returns the compressed image as a response.

## Dependencies

The application uses the following dependencies:

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing.
NumPy: A library for numerical computing.
Jinja2: A templating engine for HTML templates.

## Requirements

The application requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Flask
OpenCV
NumPy
Jinja2

## Installation Instructions

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using Git.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-optimizer.git

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies using pip.
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment using virtualenv.
virtualenv venv

## Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate

## Step 5: Create a Configuration File

Create a config.py file in the instance directory with the required settings.
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
UPLOAD_FOLDER = './uploads'

## Step 6: Run the Application

Run the application using the following command.
python run.py

## Step 7: Access the Application

Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## Development Environment

To set up a development environment, follow these steps:

1. Install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
2. Install a debugger such as pdb or PyCharm's built-in debugger.
3. Set up a testing framework such as unittest or pytest.

## API Documentation

The application provides a RESTful API for image compression. The API endpoint is /upload.

Method: POST
Parameters:
image: The image file to be uploaded.
quality: The desired quality for image compression (optional, default is 90).
Response:
compressed_image: The compressed image file.

## Example Use Case

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application URL.
2. Click on the "Upload Image" button.
3. Select an image file to upload.
4. Specify the desired quality for image compression (optional).
5. Click on the "Upload" button.
6. The compressed image will be downloaded to your computer.

## Troubleshooting

Check the logs for errors.
Verify that the config.py file is correctly configured.
Ensure that the dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

## Modification

To modify the application, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make changes to the code.
3. Test the changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

## Commit Messages

When committing changes, follow these guidelines:

Use a clear and concise commit message.
Use the present tense (e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
Use the imperative mood (e.g. "Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug").

## Code Style

When writing code, follow these guidelines:

Use PEP 8 style guidelines.
Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
Use descriptive variable names.
Use comments to explain complex code.
